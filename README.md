# Advanced-Lane-detection-project
# Project Steps :
 1] Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images which located in [camera_cal] .
 
 2] Apply a distortion correction to images.  
 3] Apply a perspective transform to get olan view image (prespective_forward).

4]first you should draw the histogram of the binary picture to detect the position of the lanes that is most likely to be found
5] using the histogram we can find the initial position of the lane
6] after finding the initial position we will apply the sliding window search which helps to detect the lane position whether it is curved or a straight line

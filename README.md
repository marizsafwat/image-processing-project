# Advanced-Lane-detection-project
# Project Steps :
 1] Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images which located in [camera_cal] .
 
 2] Apply a distortion correction to images.  
 
 3] Apply a perspective transform to get plan view image (prespective_forward).
 
4] first you should draw the histogram of the binary picture to detect the position of the lanes that is most likely to be found
5] using the histogram we can find the initial position of the lane
6] after finding the initial position we will apply the sliding window search which helps to detect the lane position whether it is curved or a straight line 
7] The input video is then sent to the process_image function which applies all the previous steps to each frame
8] The process_image functions converts the images to binary to make it easier for lane detection
9] Vehicle position and radius of curvature are then calculated by calling their functions
10] The pictures are then sent to add_text function to write the data on each frame
11] Finally the process_image function concatinates the different outputs of each stage together to show the final output
